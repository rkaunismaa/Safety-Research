Today I prompted the Claude CLI (using Sonnet 4.5) with the following command:

    Scan the contents of the persona_vectors folder and the archive article https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21509 and then generate a      
    jupyter notebook that demonstrates what these 2 resources are expressing. Call the notebook persona_vectors.ipynb. Use the model  
    found at https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to demonstrate these concepts. 

It chewed on this for about a minute, and then cranked out 'persona_vectors.ipynb'. I am simply stunned on how useful this tool is!!
