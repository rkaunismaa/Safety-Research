    "# Bloom: Automated Behavioral Evaluations for LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bloom** is an open-source agentic framework from Anthropic for generating behavioral evaluations of frontier AI models. It enables researchers to automatically assess how AI systems exhibit specific behaviors (sycophancy, self-preservation, political bias, etc.) without manual evaluation pipeline engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated scenario generation**: Generates diverse test scenarios for any specified behavior\n",
    "- **Four-stage pipeline**: Understanding → Ideation → Rollout → Judgment\n",
    "- **Multi-provider support**: Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and more via LiteLLM\n",
    "- **W&B integration**: Scale experiments with Weights & Biases sweeps\n",
    "- **Validated results**: Strong correlation with human judgment (Spearman: 0.86 with Claude Opus 4.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",

    "## The Four-Stage Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom's evaluation pipeline consists of four stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Understanding\n",
    "An agent reads the behavior description and any few-shot example transcripts, then generates a detailed understanding of what you're trying to measure. This includes the mechanisms by which the behavior manifests, why it matters scientifically, and summaries of your examples. Bloom reuses this context to keep each agent on track and prevent safety refusals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ideation\n",
    "The agent generates evaluation scenarios designed to elicit your behavior of interest. Each scenario description is highly detailed—it includes:\n",
    "- The situation\n",
    "- The simulated user\n",
    "- The target model's system prompt\n",
    "- The interaction environment\n",
    "- An example of how the behavior might manifest\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Rollout\n",
    "An agent rolls out these evaluation scenarios in parallel, first writing a system prompt and initial user message based on the scenario from the ideation stage. Throughout the rollout, the agent simulates both the user and any tool responses—so the environment develops dynamically as the agent tries to elicit the behavior. The rollout continues until the agent either reaches the maximum number of turns or successfully elicits the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Judgment\n",
    "The judge model reviews and scores each transcript for the target behavior plus secondary qualities that help contextualize the score. These scores and summaries then go to a **meta-judge**, which produces a report with:\n",
    "- Overall suite summary\n",
    "- Breakdown of different scenarios\n",
    "- Elicitation strategies and their success\n",
    "- Any other details you request"

    "\n",

    "1. **Configure your evaluation**: Edit `bloom-data/seed.yaml` to target a specific behavior\n",
    "2. **Set API keys**: Add your keys to `.env` and run `source .env`\n",
    "3. **Run the pipeline**: `bloom run bloom-data --debug`\n",
    "4. **View results**: Use the bloom-viewer or examine JSON files directly\n",
    "5. **Scale with W&B**: Use sweep configs from `bloom/examples/sweeps/` for large experiments\n",
